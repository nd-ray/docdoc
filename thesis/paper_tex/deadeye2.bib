abstract="We examined the generality of the claim that stereoscopic disparity is detectable in parallel across the visual field. Using a search paradigm with random-dot stereograms, we varied the relative disparity of target and distractor items. When both target and distractors had crossed disparities, both search functions (i.e., target in front of distractors and target behind distractors) were linear with positive slopes. When both target and distractors had uncrossed disparities, the pattern of results depended upon whether the target was in front of or behind the distractors---specifically, when the target was in front of the distractors, search functions were similar to those seen for ``crossed'' search, but when the target was behind the distractors, a nonlinear search function was found. Finally, when the target and distractors straddled the plane of fixation, a nonlinear search function was found when the target was in front of the distractors; however, when the target was behind the distractors, a linear search function with a large positive slope was found. We show that the nonlinear search functions are consistent with the effects of an intervening global surface percept. We also show that the size of the stimulus display may be a factor in some relative depth cases. Additionally, we replicate Steinman's (1987) finding that search is parallel when the distractors are located at the plane of fixation and the target disparity is crossed, eliminating monocular and spatial cues to target presence that may have been present in his original study. In a final control experiment, we showed that reaction times did not increase with set size when observers performed another kind of perceptual task on similar random-dot stereogram displays. This eliminates the possibility that some of the results obtained here can be explained by increases in the difficulty of perceiving/fusing the stimuli when the number of distractors is increased.",

abstract = "We investigated processes that determine the depth localization of monocular points which have no umambiguous depth. It is known that horizontally adjacent binocular objects are used in depth localization and for a distance of 25–40 min arc monocular points localize to the leading edge of a depth constraint zone, which is an area defined by the visibility lines between which the points in the real world must be. We demonstrate that this rule is not valid in complex depth scenes. Adding other disparate objects to the scene changes the localization of the monocular point in a way that cannot be explained by the da Vinci explanation of monocular-binocular integration. The effect of additional disparate objects is assymetric in depth: a crossed object does not affect the da Vinci effect but an uncrossed object biases the depth localization of monocular objects to uncrossed direction. We conclude that a horizontally adjacent binocular plane does not completely determine the depth localization of a monocular point and that depth spreading from other binocular elements biases the localization process.

Several surfaces can be classified using a transfer function by assigning optical properties like color and opacity (RGB$\alpha$) to the voxel data. Finding a good transfer function in order to separate specific structures from the volume data set, is in general a manual and time-consuming procedure, and requires detailed knowledge of the data and the image acquisition technique. In this paper, we present a new Virtual Reality (VR) application based on the HTC Vive headset. Onedimensional transfer functions can be designed in VR while continuously rendering the stereoscopic image pair through massively parallel GPUbased ray casting shader techniques. The usability of the VR application is evaluated.",

abstract = "Distant surfaces are occluded by nearer surfaces to different extents in the two eyes, leading to the existence of unpaired image points visible in one eye and not the other. An ecological analysis of the real world situation that could have given rise to such unpaired points indicates the presence of a depth constraint zone, defined by visibility lines between which possible real world points must lie. The leading edge of this zone starts at the edge of a fused binocular occluding surface and recedes linearly with increases in horizontal distance to the unpaired point. Psychophysical evidence indicates that the human visual system makes use of this unpaired information in a remarkably adaptive manner, showing an increase in perceived depth for increasing horizontal separations between the unpaired target and fused edge, at least over a significant angular range (approx. 25–40 min arc). We also show that unpaired points in binocular images can lead to the formation of subjective occluding contours and surface having the qualitatively appropriate sign of depth. Furthermore, we show that the visual system could not recover depth of unpaired points camouflaged from the other eye against silhouettes. Our findings indicate that the visual system makes use of occlusive relations in the real world to recover depth, contour, and surface from unpaired points. The fact that such processes must utilize eye-of-origin information implies that they share this essential characteristic with classical or Wheatstone stereopsis. The necessity of eye-of-origin information also suggests that the processing may begin relatively early in cortical visual processing, possibly as early as V1. Finally, the novel emergence of subjective occluding contours from unpaired monocular stimuli raises the possibility that this process is mediated by visual experience, built up by the association of unpaired points and occluding contours."

abstract = "We propose a new model for da Vinci stereopsis based on a coarse-to-fine disparity energy computation in V1 and disparity-boundary-selective units in V2. Unlike previous work, our model contains only binocular cells, relies on distributed representations of disparity, and has a simple V1-to-V2 feedforward structure. We demonstrate with random-dot stereograms that the V2 stage of our model is able to determine the location and the eye-of-origin of monocularly occluded regions, and improve disparity map computation. We also examine a few related issues. First, we argue that since monocular regions are binocularly defined, they cannot generally be detected by monocular cells. Second, we show that our coarse-to-fine V1 model for conventional stereopsis explains double matching in Panum’s limiting case. This provides computational support to the notion that the perceived depth of a monocular bar next to a binocular rectangle may not be da Vinci stereopsis per se [Gillam, B., Cook, M., & Blackburn, S. (2003). Monocular discs in the occlusion zones of binocular surfaces do not have quantitative depth—a comparison with Panum’s limiting case. Perception 32, 1009–1019.]. Third, we demonstrate that some stimuli previously deemed invalid have simple, valid geometric interpretations. Our work suggests that studies of da Vinci stereopsis should focus on stimuli more general than the bar-and-rectangle type and that disparity-boundary-selective V2 cells may provide a simple physiological mechanism for da Vinci stereopsis."

When an object is occluded by another object in the scene, so that it is visible only in one eye, its retinal disparity cannot be computed. Nakayama and Shimojo (1990) found that a percept of quantitative depth between the two objects could still be established for such stimuli and proposed that this percept is based on the constraints imposed by occlusion geometry. They named this and other occlusion-based depth phenomena “da Vinci stereopsis.” Subsequent research found quantitative depth based on occlusion geometry in several other classes of stimuli grouped under the term da Vinci stereopsis. However, Nakayama and Shimojo's findings were later brought into question by Gillam, Cook, and Blackburn (2003), who suggested that quantitative depth in their stimuli was perceived based on conventional disparity. In order to understand whether da Vinci stereopsis relies on one type of mechanism or whether its function is stimulus dependent we examine the nature and source of depth in the class of stimuli used by Nakayama and Shimojo (1990). We use three different psychophysical and computational methods to show that the most likely source for depth in these stimuli is occlusion geometry. Based on these experiments and previous data we discuss the potential mechanisms responsible for processing depth from monocular features in da Vinci stereopsis. }",

The large amount of possibly impacting factors and variety as well as a certain subtlety of measured effects on user experience make it difficult to grasp the overall potential of using S3D vision. In a comprehensive approach, we (a) present a development framework which summarizes possible variables in display technology, content creation and human factors, and (b) list a scheme of S3D user experience effects concerning initial fascination, emotions, performance, and behavior as well as negative feelings of discomfort and complexity. As a major contribution we propose a qualitative formalization which derives dependencies between development factors and user effects. The argumentation is based on several previously published user studies. We further show how to apply this formula to identify possible opportunities and threats in content creation as well as how to pursue future steps for a possible quantification.},

	Abstract = {Proceeding from the idea of Chernoff (1971, 1973) of representing multivariate data by faces, a new face is proposed in which the face parameters of the left and the right side can be varied separately. The new face can be applied in the same way as the usual Chernoff face (with 36 instead of 18 representable variables). Special applications of the new face are the representation of multivariate paired comparison and the visual search for outliers. Several examples illustrate these applications. Compared with Chernoff's face, the new construction is more realistic, degenerates less, and avoids as much as possible mutual influences of the different face parameters.},

Each point in k-dimensional space, k \&{\#}x2264; 18, is represented by a cartoon of a face whose features, such as length of nose and curvature of mouth, correspond to components of the point. Thus every multivariate observation is visualized as a computer-drawn face. This presentation makes it easy for the human mind to grasp many of the essential regularities and irregularities present in the data. Other graphical representations are described briefly.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe an empirical investigation of the utility of several perceptual properties of motion in information-dense displays applied to notification. Notification relates to awareness and how dynamic information is communicated from the system to the user. Key to a notification technique is how easily the notification is detected and identified. Our initial studies show that icons with simple motions, termed moticons, are effective coding techniques for notification and in fact are often better detected and identified than colour and shape codes, especially in the periphery. A subsequent experiment compared the detection and distraction effects of different motion types in several task conditions. Our results reveal how different attributes of motion contribute to detection, identification and distraction and provide initial guidelines on how motion codes can be designed to support awareness in information-rich interfaces while minimizing unwanted side effects of distraction and irritation.},

	Abstract = {Visualizing information in user interfaces to complex, large-scale systems is difficult due to visual fragmentation caused by an enormous amount of inter-related data distributed across multiple views. New display dimensions are required to help the user visually integrate and filter such spatially distributed and heterogeneous information. Motion holds promise in this regard as a perceptually efficient display dimension. It has long been known to have a strong grouping effect, suggesting it has potential for filtering and brushing techniques. However, there is little known about which properties of motion are most effective. This paper reviews the prior literature relating to the use of motion for display and discusses the requirements for how motion can be usefully applied to these problems, especially for visualizations incorporating multiple groups of data objects. Results from previous research by the authors suggested motion type was a strong distinguishing feature. Three types of motions in pairwise combinations were compared: linear, circular and expansion/contraction. Combinations of linear directions were also compared to evaluate how great angular separation needs to be to enforce perceptual distinction. The results showed that motion can effectively group objects that are otherwise dissimilar. Type differentiation is more effective than directional differences (except for 90$\,^{\circ}$). Of the three types studied, circular demands the most attention. Angular separation must be 90$\,^{\circ}$to be equally effective. These results suggest that motion can be usefully applied to both filtering and brushing. They also provide the beginnings of a vocabulary of simple motions that can be applied to information visualization.},

@article{Pomplun:2013:TET,
	Abstract = {Analyzing the factors that determine our choice of visual search strategy may shed light on visual behavior in everyday situations. Previous results suggest that increasing task difficulty leads to more systematic search paths. Here we analyze observers' eye movements in an ``easy''conjunction search task and a ``difficult''shape search task to study visual search strategies in stereoscopic search displays with virtual depth induced by binocular disparity. Standard eye-movement variables, such as fixation duration and initial saccade latency, as well as new measures proposed here, such as saccadic step size, relative saccadic selectivity, and x−y target distance, revealed systematic effects on search dynamics in the horizontal-vertical plane throughout the search process. We found that in the ``easy''task, observers start with the processing of display items in the display center immediately after stimulus onset and subsequently move their gaze outwards, guided by extrafoveally perceived stimulus color. In contrast, the ``difficult''task induced an initial gaze shift to the upper-left display corner, followed by a systematic left-right and top-down search process. The only consistent depth effect was a trend of initial saccades in the easy task with smallest displays to the items closest to the observer. The results demonstrate the utility of eye-movement analysis for understanding search strategies and provide a first step toward studying search strategies in actual 3D scenarios.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a low-cost, practical gaze-contingent display in which natural images are presented to the observer with dioptric blur and stereoscopic disparity that are dependent on the three-dimensional structure of natural scenes. Our system simulates a distribution of retinal blur and depth similar to that experienced in real-world viewing conditions by emmetropic observers. We implemented the system using light-field photographs taken with a plenoptic camera which supports digital refocusing anywhere in the images. We coupled this capability with an eye-tracking system and stereoscopic rendering. With this display, we examine how the time course of binocular fusion depends on depth cues from blur and stereoscopic disparity in naturalistic images. Our results show that disparity and peripheral blur interact to modify eye-movement behavior and facilitate binocular fusion, and the greatest benefit was gained by observers who struggled most to achieve fusion. Even though plenoptic images do not replicate an individual's aberrations, the results demonstrate that a naturalistic distribution of depth-dependent blur may improve 3-D virtual reality, and that interruptions of this pattern (e.g., with intraocular lenses) which flatten the distribution of retinal blur may adversely affect binocular fusion.},

	Abstract = {Binocular rivalry (BR) is an intriguing phenomenon that occurs when two different images are presented, one to each eye, resulting in alternation or rivalry between the percepts. The phenomenon has been studied for nearly 200 years, with renewed and intensive investigation over recent decades. The rate of perceptual switching has long been known to vary widely between individuals but to be relatively stable within individuals. A recent twin study demonstrated that individual variation in BR rate is under substantial genetic control, a finding that also represented the first report, using a large study, of genetic contribution for any post-retinal visual processing phenomenon. The twin study had been prompted by earlier work showing BR rate was slow in the heritable psychiatric condition, bipolar disorder (BD). Together, these studies suggested that slow BR may represent an endophenotype for BD, and heralded the advent of modern clinical and genetic studies of rivalry. This new focus has coincided with rapid advances in 3D display technology, but despite such progress, specific development of technology for rivalry research has been lacking. This review therefore compares different display methods for BR research across several factors, including viewing parameters, image quality, equipment cost, compatibility with other investigative methods, subject group, and sample size, with a focus on requirements specific to large-scale clinical and genetic studies. It is intended to be a resource for investigators new to BR research, such as clinicians and geneticists, and to stimulate the development of 3D display technology for advancing interdisciplinary studies of rivalry.},

	Abstract = {Summary Reading, an essential skill for successful function in today's society, is a complex psychological process involving vision, memory, and language comprehension [1, 2]. Variability in fixation durations during reading reflects the ease of text comprehension [3--5], and increased word frequency results in reduced fixation times [6--8]. Critically, readers not only process the fixated foveal word but also preprocess the parafoveal word to its right, thereby facilitating subsequent foveal processing. Typically, text is presented binocularly, and the oculomotor control system precisely coordinates the two frontally positioned eyes online [7, 9--13]. Binocular, compared to monocular, visual processing typically leads to superior performance [10, 13--15], termed the ``binocular advantage''; few studies have investigated the binocular advantage in reading [16--18]. We used saccade-contingent display change methodology [19] to demonstrate the benefit of binocular relative to monocular text presentation for both parafoveal and foveal lexical processing during reading. Our results demonstrate that denial of a unified visual signal derived from binocular inputs provides a cost to the efficiency of reading, particularly in relation to high-frequency words. Our findings fit neatly with current computational models of eye movement control during reading, wherein successful word identification is a primary determinant of saccade initiation.},

	Abstract = {We examined the generality of the claim that stereoscopic disparity is detectable in parallel across the visual field. Using a search paradigm with random-dot stereograms, we varied the relative disparity of target and distractor items. When both target and distractors had crossed disparities, both search functions (i.e., target in front of distractors and target behind distractors) were linear with positive slopes. When both target and distractors had uncrossed disparities, the pattern of results depended upon whether the target was in front of or behind the distractors---specifically, when the target was in front of the distractors, search functions were similar to those seen for ``crossed''search, but when the target was behind the distractors, a nonlinear search function was found. Finally, when the target and distractors straddled the plane of fixation, a nonlinear search function was found when the target was in front of the distractors; however, when the target was behind the distractors, a linear search function with a large positive slope was found. We show that the nonlinear search functions are consistent with the effects of an intervening global surface percept. We also show that the size of the stimulus display may be a factor in some relative depth cases. Additionally, we replicate Steinman's (1987) finding that search is parallel when the distractors are located at the plane of fixation and the target disparity is crossed, eliminating monocular and spatial cues to target presence that may have been present in his original study. In a final control experiment, we showed that reaction times did not increase with set size when observers performed another kind of perceptual task on similar random-dot stereogram displays. This eliminates the possibility that some of the results obtained here can be explained by increases in the difficulty of perceiving/fusing the stimuli when the number of distractors is increased.},

	Abstract = {Does the visual system represent stereoscopic depth purely as a map of local disparities, or does it explicitly represent local relationships of disparity, such as disparity gradients? Experiments are reported in which visual search for a target containing the same disparity range as other elements in the display, but differing in the relationship of the disparities (stereo slant), was used to determine whether the target showed ?pop-out? like a unitary feature, or the serial search characteristic of feature conjunctions. Each stereo pair of elements was selected randomly from a range of outline parallelograms leaning to the right or to the left, so that the target could not be identified using any monocular shape cue.Response times for detection of the target (present on 50{\%} of the trials) were independent of the number of elements in the display. This result was confirmed by varying element size and spacing, and by using oblique crosses rather than parallelograms as stimuli. It is concluded that stereoscopically defined slant, or disparity gradient, can be processed and compared in parallel across the display, and acts in this respect as an explicit unitary visual property. This contrasts with findings in analogous experiments on movement, which show that targets defined by divergence or deformation of optic flow can only be identified by serial search.},

	Abstract = {The present experiment examined the shape of the attentional gradient in three-dimensional space. Subjects performed a response-compatibility task in which they were instructed to respond to a centrally located target and ignore flanking distractors. The irrelevant distractors were presented at combinations of seven different depths, three different horizontal separations, and three different vertical separations relative to the target. Depth was varied in a stereoscopic display viewed through polarized glasses. Overall, the size of the response-compatibility effect decreased with increased separation in all three dimensions. Interestingly, the response-compatibility effect was larger for horizontal separations than for vertical separations and was larger for crossed disparities than for uncrossed disparities. The results suggest an elliptical focus of attention, with steeper gradients in the vertical dimensions than in the horizontal dimensions. In addition, the results suggest, along the vertical dimension, a steeper gradient for objects located beyond the focus of attention relative to that for objects located between the observer and the focus of attention.},

	Abstract = {Concerns about potentially harmful effects on the visual system due to the use of head mounted displays (HMDs) in general, and stereoscopic systems in particular, have been raised in the literature. Most of the concerns were based on studies measuring visual function changes following short-term use of HMDs. This study measured functional changes in binocular vision, accommodation, and resolution following 30 min use of HMD in both stereoscopic- and non-stereoscopic modes, and compared them to changes following the same task performed on a desk-top CRT display. No functional differences were found between HMD and CRT and most measured changes were too small to be considered clinically meaningful. An evaluation of subjective comfort found a statistically significant difference in the impression of comfort between the CRT and the HMD in stereoscopic mode, with the latter being less comfortable. It can be concluded that the functional changes reported following short term use of HMDs are not specific to stereoscopic presentation and do not differ from those caused by desk-top CRT display.},

Subjects viewed random-dot stereogram displays in which they responded differentially to vertical and horizontal bars. Adjacent noise elements either were identical to the response target or specified the opposite response. The position of the noise elements was varied in depth according to binocular disparity. Interference by incompatible noise elements decreased with depth separation between the noise elements and response target. In addition, interference was greater for noise elements that were more distant from the observer than from the response target than it was for noise elements that were closer to the observer than to the response target. The implications of these results for a viewer-centered representation of focused attention in depth are discussed.},

An important question, however, is whether visual awareness is necessary for binocular rivalry to emerge. To address this question, we presented conflicting random dot motion stimuli in the two eyes at luminance contrasts around perceptual threshold. We asked subjects to report continuously, via button presses, if they noticed any kind of motion in the display (be it coherent or not) and indicate which direction of motion they thought was dominant at any given instant even if they were unaware of any motion in the display. We biased the competition between the two dichoptic stimuli by changing the motion coherence in one eye while keeping it fixed in the other to test if this induced predictable changes in rivalry dynamics. We also probed the strength of the interocular suppression. Our data show that binocular rivalry continues even if subjects claim complete absence of visual motion awareness. This remarkable dissociation between visually guided behavior and visual awareness resembles the dissociation seen in other phenomena, such as blindsight and visual masking. Fluctuations in awareness that did occur were temporally linked to the dominance switches in a manner that is consistent with adaptation reciprocal-inhibition models of binocular rivalry.},

	N2 = {Abstract When wearing a monocular head-worn display (HWD), such as in an Air Force simulation and training environment, one eye views the HWD symbology while both eyes view a simulated out-the-window (OTW) scene. This may create interocular differences in image characteristics that could disrupt binocular vision by provoking visual suppression (i.e., binocular rivalry), thus reducing visibility of the OTW scene, monocular symbology, or both. However, binocular fusion of the OTW scene may mitigate against the occurrence of visual suppression, a hypothesis that was investigated in this study. Across two experiments the effects of optic flow rate and target contrast on visual suppression were also investigated. For each experiment, observers viewed a simulated OTW scene and HWD symbology while performing a target recognition task under three viewing conditions. In a partial-fusion condition, observers viewed the OTW scene with both eyes and the symbology with only one eye. In a no-fusion (dichoptic) condition, observers viewed the OTW scene and symbology with different eyes. In a full-fusion control condition, both the OTW scene and symbology were viewed with both eyes. Elevation in duration threshold for a briefly-presented target served as a measure of suppression. The results revealed that, compared to the full-fusion condition, thresholds were elevated for the partial-fusion condition, but to a lesser extent than the no-fusion condition. Increasing target contrast produced less suppression while increasing optic flow rate produced greater suppression. We conclude that under conditions that simulate a semi-transparent monocular HWD, binocular rivalry is present.},

	Abstract = {Focus+context techniques provide visual guidance in
               visualizations by giving strong visual prominence to
               elements of interest while the context is suppressed.
               However, finding a visual feature to enhance for the focus
               to pop out from its context in a large dynamic scene, while
               leading to minimal visual deformation and subjective
               disturbance, is challenging. This paper proposes Attractive
               Flicker, a novel technique for visual guidance in dynamic
               narrative visualizations. We first show that flicker is a
               strong visual attractor in the entire visual field, without
               distorting, suppressing, or adding any scene elements. The
               novel aspect of our Attractive Flicker technique is that it
               consists of two signal stages: The first ``orientation
               stage'' is a short but intensive flicker stimulus to
               attract the attention to elements of interest. Subsequently,
               the intensive flicker is reduced to a minimally disturbing
               luminance oscillation (``engagement stage'') as visual
               support to keep track of the focus elements. To find a good
               trade-off between attraction effectiveness and subjective
               annoyance caused by flicker, we conducted two perceptual
               studies to find suitable signal parameters. We showcase
               Attractive Flicker with the parameters obtained from the
               perceptual statistics in a study of molecular interactions.
               With Attractive Flicker, users were able to easily follow
               the narrative of the visualization on a large display, while
               the flickering of focus elements was not disturbing when
               observing the context.},
