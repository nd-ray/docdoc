    abstract = { Playing entertainment computer, video, and portable games, namely, digital games, is receiving more and more attention in academic research. Games are studied in different situations with numerous methods, but little is known about if and how the playing situation affects the user experience (UX) in games. In addition, it is hard to understand and study the psychology of UX in games. The objective of this study is to show how UX differs when the first-person shooter HALO is played in a laboratory and at home. To disclose this difference, a psychologically valid and multidimensional measurement framework is introduced. UX is profiled according to the level of the sense of presence, involvement, and flow in a between-subjects design. Statistically, the structure of the framework is grounded on a large and heterogeneous gamer data set (N = 2,182). The results showed that the profile of the sense of presence in the laboratory included higher levels of attention and arousal as compared with that of the natural environment. This finding was independent of any of the measured background variables. Other differences between the two situations were more related to the participants’ background. For example, gamers at home were more involved in the game and they felt a higher level of competence. No strong emotional differences between the two situations were found. The authors discuss the complex UX terminology and implications of the framework for implementation of learning games. }

abstract = {The concept of presence, i.e. the sensation of 'being there' in a mediated environment, has received substantial attention from the virtual reality community, and is becoming increasingly relevant both to broadcasters and display developers. Although research into presence is still at an early stage of development, there is a consensus that presence has multiple determinants. To identify and test which parameters affect presence, a reliable, robust and valid means of measuring presence is required. In this paper, we describe the categories of factors thought to have an impact on presence. Furthermore, we present an overview of various approaches taken to measuring presence, which can be divided into two general categories: subjective measures and objective corroborative measures. Since presence is a subjective experience, the most direct way of assessment is through users' subjective report. This approach has serious limitations however, and should be used judiciously. Objective measures, such as postural, physiological or social responses to media, can be used to corroborate subjective measures, thereby overcoming some of their limitations. At present, the most promising direction for presence measurement is to develop and use an aggregate measure of presence that is comprised of both subjective and objective components, tailored to the specific medium under study.},

abstract="Expansion of games industry came in modern life, accompanied with innovative features in a game controller. Nowadays mobile industry is booming with the expansion of the variety of novel technologies, such as the use of 3D accelerometer sensors, high resolution cameras, the capability of connecting to wireless networks and so on. Therefore, a smartphone can be added with the game control functions to become a mobile game controller. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of making a mobile phone as a game controller using User Datagram Protocol socket programming. This system is developed by Java 2 Standard Edition and Google Android Software Development Kits which has already provided sensor and multi-touch APIs. We successfully realize a reconfigurable mobile game controller on a mobile smartphone to interact with the existing digital games by mapping control functions on the server. Acceptable performance is shown to validate the effectiveness of our solution.",
