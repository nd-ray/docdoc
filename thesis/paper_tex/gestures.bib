This paper describes the design and evaluation of a technique, Direct Pointer, that enables users to interact intuitively with large displays using cameras equipped on handheld devices, such as mobile phones and personal digital assistant (PDA). In contrast to many existing interaction methods that attempt to address the same problem, ours offers direct manipulation of the pointer position with continuous visual feedback. The primary advantage of this technique is that it only requires equipments that are readily available: a large electronic display, a handheld camera, and a connection between the two. No special visual markers in the display content are needed, nor are fixed cameras pointing at the display. We evaluated the performance of Direct Pointer as an interaction product, showing that it performs as well as comparable techniques that require more sophisticated equipment.

Within this work, we seek to identify automatic nonverbal behavior descriptors that correlate with expert-assessments of behaviors characteristic of good and bad public speaking performances. We present a novel multimodal corpus recorded with a virtual audience public speaking training platform. Lastly, we utilize the behavior descriptors to automatically approximate the overall assessment of the performance using support vector regression in a speaker-independent experiment and yield promising results approaching human performance⬚⬚⬚},
